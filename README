A hack into the Drupal CAS module (7.x-1.1 version) to add integration with Rules Module (7.x-2.0 version).

This adds:
1) a new event to the Drupal Rules module event list named "User is authentificated via CAS" that is performing after an authentification via the CAS module.
2) a new condition to the Drupal Rules module conditions list named "User is CAS authentificated" that is performing only if the user is a CAS authentificated user.
Usage
* Add the cas.rules.inc file to cas directory.
* Apply the patch against cas.module
